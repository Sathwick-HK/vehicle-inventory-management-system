# 🚗 Vehicle Inventory Management System – REST API
### *A Python + Django REST Framework Backend Project*

This project is a fully functional backend API built using **Python**, **Django**, and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
It allows users to manage vehicle inventory through standard **CRUD operations**.

This project helps develop core backend skills, including:

- REST API development  
- Django models, serializers, views, URLs  
- API design & database interaction  
- CRUD operations with Django ORM  

---

## 🌟 Features

- Add new vehicles to inventory  
- Retrieve vehicle list  
- Update vehicle details  
- Delete vehicles  
- JSON-based API responses  
- Uses Django ORM & SQLite  
- Clean and modular app structure  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Django**  
- **Django REST Framework**  
- **SQLite (default DB, can be replaced with MySQL/PostgreSQL)**
